# React Native Expo example

Hi, welcome to my React Native example app using Expo. This app was made for presentation purposes.

## What's it about

This app consists of a simple screen, that uses some important daily basis development libraries for React Native. For the basic screen components style it was used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) along with [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/). As an example it uses [React Native Elements](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/) components.
